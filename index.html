            Clothing reflects personality, because people usually wear what they like and what makes them
                feel good about themselves. In this day and age it is very hard to keep up with each
                generationâ€™s trend be it on how I carry myself through my clothes or how I represent myself
                through my personality. Each person or group has his or her own style the styles reflect their
                way of life. If one plays sports, he or she tends to be more casual in their choice of clothes
                if one socializes with a snobbish crowd he or she tends to be undecided in choosing clothing.
                People have their own preference of getting clothes based on their personality. And we are here
                to help the customer decicions on choosing any clothes and make their experience better. </p>
